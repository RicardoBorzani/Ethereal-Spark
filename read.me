#80: Ethereal-Spark-patch-3C Add support for data ingestion from external sources

1: Research and understand the Kafka and/or Flume APIs and how they can be integrated with Spark.
 - Learn about Kafka and/or Flume and how they are used for data ingestion.
 - Understand the API documentation and usage patterns for Kafka and/or Flume.
 - Familiarize yourself with how Spark integrates with Kafka and/or Flume.

2: Design a data ingestion architecture that fits the requirements of Ethereal-Spark.
 - Identify the data sources and types of data that will be ingested.
 - Define the data ingestion pipeline architecture, including the sources, data transformation steps, and destination(s).
 - Consider factors such as scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.

3: Implement the data ingestion component using the Kafka and/or Flume APIs.
 - Use the design created in step 2 to implement the data ingestion pipeline.
 - Use the Kafka and/or Flume APIs to stream data into Spark for processing.
 - Ensure that the data ingestion component is robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant.

4: Write unit tests for the data ingestion component.
 - Develop unit tests to ensure that the data ingestion component functions as intended.
 - Ensure that the unit tests cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
 - Use a testing framework like pytest or JUnit to automate the testing process.

5: Integrate the data ingestion component with the existing Spark jobs in Ethereal-Spark.
 - Modify the existing Spark jobs to incorporate data from the new data ingestion pipeline.
 - Ensure that the data is processed and stored correctly within the Spark jobs.

6: Write integration tests for the data ingestion component and Spark jobs.
 - Develop integration tests to ensure that the data ingestion pipeline and Spark jobs function correctly together.
 - Ensure that the integration tests cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.
 - Use a testing framework like pytest or JUnit to automate the testing process.

7: Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
 - Review the code and identify any areas for improvement.
 - Use best practices and coding standards to make the code more readable and maintainable.
 - Eliminate code duplication and simplify complex code structures where possible.
 - Use meaningful variable and function names to improve code comprehension.
