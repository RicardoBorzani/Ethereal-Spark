#70: Ethereal-Spark-patch-1B Write a Spark job to extract data from a CSV file

1: Define the CSV file schema and ensure it matches the expected format:
 - First, you'll need to review the CSV file's structure and define the schema for the data.
 - This can be done using the StructType and StructField classes in Spark.
 - Ensure that the schema matches the expected format, including data types and column names.

2: Load the CSV file into a Spark DataFrame using SparkSession's read method:
 - Use the SparkSession object to create a DataFrameReader and read in the CSV file.
 - Specify the file path, format, and options such as header and delimiter.
 - Load the data into a DataFrame.

3: Apply any necessary transformations to the DataFrame to clean or format the data:
 - Depending on the requirements of the job, you may need to apply various transformations to the data.
 - This can include filtering, aggregation, joining with other data sources, and more.
 - Ensure that the transformations properly handle any edge cases or unexpected data.

4: Write the resulting DataFrame to disk or persist it in memory for further processing:
 - Once the data has been transformed, you'll need to write it to a file or persist it in memory for further processing.
 - Use the DataFrameWriter to write the data to a file or output sink.
 - Alternatively, you can persist the data in memory using cache() or persist().

5: Add error handling and logging to handle any issues that may arise during the job's execution:
 - It's important to add error handling and logging to ensure that the job executes correctly and any issues are properly handled.
 - Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and log any errors or warnings using a logging framework such as Log4j.

6: Write unit tests to ensure the job performs as expected for different input scenarios and edge cases:
 - Finally, write unit tests to ensure that the job performs as expected for different input scenarios and edge cases.
 - This can include testing the job with different input files, testing edge cases such as null or missing data, and more.
 - Use a testing framework such as JUnit or ScalaTest to write the tests.
