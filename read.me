#71: Ethereal-Spark-patch-1C Write a Spark job to transform data and aggregate statistics

1: Define the transformations and statistics to be applied to the input data:
 - Review the input data and define the transformations and statistical aggregations to be applied.
 - This can include filtering, aggregation, joining with other data sources, and more.
 - Ensure that the transformations and statistical aggregations properly handle any edge cases or unexpected data.

2: Load the input data from the CSV file using Spark's DataFrame API or RDD API:
 - Use the SparkSession object to create a DataFrameReader and read in the CSV file.
 - Specify the file path, format, and options such as header and delimiter.
 - Load the data into a DataFrame or RDD.

3: Apply the defined transformations and statistical aggregations to the input data using Spark's DataFrame API or RDD API:
 - Use Spark's DataFrame or RDD APIs to apply the defined transformations and statistical aggregations to the input data.
 - This can include using methods such as filter(), groupBy(), agg(), and more.
 - Ensure that the transformations and statistical aggregations are applied correctly.

4: Persist the transformed and aggregated data to a database or file system using Spark's DataFrame API or RDD API:
 - Once the data has been transformed and aggregated, you'll need to persist it to a database or file system.
 - Use the DataFrameWriter or RDD methods to write the data to a file or output sink.
 - Alternatively, you can persist the data in memory using cache() or persist().

5: Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the transformation and statistical aggregation logic:
 - Finally, write unit tests to ensure that the transformation and statistical aggregation logic is correct.
 - This can include testing the job with different input files, testing edge cases such as null or missing data, and more.
 - Use a testing framework such as JUnit or ScalaTest to write the tests.
