#76: Ethereal-Spark-patch-2D Write integration tests for Spark jobs

1: Identify the Spark jobs that need integration tests.
 - Review the codebase and identify the Spark jobs that require integration tests.
 - Prioritize the Spark jobs based on their importance to the project.

2: Define the expected input and output data for each job.
 - Determine the input data required for each Spark job.
 - Define the expected output data for each Spark job.

3: Create test data sets to use as input for the Spark jobs.
 - Create test data sets that simulate the expected input data for each Spark job.
 - Generate the test data sets using a tool or script that can generate synthetic data or extract data from a production system.

4: Run the Spark jobs on the test data sets.
 - Execute the Spark jobs on the test data sets.
 - Capture the output data produced by the Spark jobs.

5: Verify that the output of each job matches the expected output.
 - Compare the output data produced by the Spark jobs with the expected output data.
 - Verify that the Spark jobs produce the expected results and handle errors and exceptions correctly.

6: Document the test cases and results.
 - Record the test cases and the input and output data for each Spark job.
 - Document any issues or errors encountered during the testing process.
 - Include the documentation in the project's knowledge base or documentation.

7: Automate the integration tests using a testing framework like pytest or JUnit.
 - Write test scripts that automate the integration tests for the Spark jobs.
 - Use a testing framework like pytest or JUnit to manage and run the tests.
 - Ensure that the test scripts are integrated into the project's continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

8: Integrate the tests into the project's continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
 - Integrate the automated integration tests into the project's continuous integration and deployment pipeline.
 - Ensure that the tests are run automatically before deploying any changes to production.
 - Monitor the test results and fix any issues that arise.
