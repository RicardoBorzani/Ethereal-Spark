Ethereal-Spark-patch-1A Set up a basic Apache Spark cluster with one worker node

Overview

This Pull Request aims to set up a basic Apache Spark cluster with one worker node. This will allow us to test and run Spark jobs on a distributed computing environment.

Tasks

1: Choose a cloud provider or set up your own hardware to host the Spark cluster.
 - You can choose any cloud provider that supports Spark, such as AWS, GCP, or Azure. Alternatively, you can set up your own hardware using commodity servers.
 - Make sure you have enough resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) to run Spark and your workload.

2: Install the latest version of Apache Spark on the cluster.
 - Follow the official documentation for your chosen platform to install and configure Spark.
 - Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access to install and configure Spark.

3: Configure Spark to run in standalone mode with one worker node.
 - Edit the Spark configuration files to set up the cluster in standalone mode with one worker node.
 - Make sure the worker node has enough resources to run Spark jobs.

4: Verify that Spark is running correctly by submitting a sample job.
 - Write a simple Spark job, such as word count or data aggregation, and submit it to the Spark cluster.
 - Verify that the job completes successfully and produces the expected output.

5: Test connectivity to the Spark cluster from your development environment.
 - Make sure you can connect to the Spark cluster from your development environment using the Spark APIs or client libraries.
 - Test basic operations, such as submitting a job, retrieving job status, and accessing cluster metrics.

6: Write documentation on how to set up and connect to the Spark cluster.
 - Document the steps and configurations required to set up and configure the Spark cluster.
 - Include instructions on how to connect to the cluster from a development environment and submit Spark jobs.

Conclusion
 - Once all the tasks are completed, we will have a basic Apache Spark cluster with one worker node up and running. This will allow us to test and develop Spark applications on a distributed computing environment.
