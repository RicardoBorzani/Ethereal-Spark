#72: Ethereal-Spark-patch-1D Write unit tests for Spark jobs

1: Identify the Spark jobs that require unit testing:
 - Review the Spark jobs in your codebase and identify those that require unit testing.
 - Consider the complexity of the job, the potential for errors or bugs, and the criticality of the job to the overall system.

2: Create a test suite for each Spark job:
 - Create a separate test suite for each Spark job you've identified for testing.
 - Each test suite should be focused on testing a specific Spark job.

3: Write test cases to cover different scenarios and edge cases:
 - Write test cases to cover different input scenarios and edge cases.
 - This can include testing with different data inputs, null or missing data, and unexpected data formats.
 - Ensure that each test case is properly designed to test a specific aspect of the Spark job.

4: Run the test suite to ensure that all tests pass:
 - Run the test suite to ensure that all tests pass and there are no errors or failures.
 - Review the output of the test suite to ensure that all aspects of the Spark job are being tested.

5: Refactor the code to improve testability if necessary:
 - If necessary, refactor the code to make it more testable.
 - This can include breaking down the Spark job into smaller functions, reducing complexity, and ensuring proper separation of concerns.

6: Integrate the unit tests into the development process to ensure that all future changes are properly tested:
 - Finally, integrate the unit tests into your development process to ensure that all future changes are properly tested.
 - Use a continuous integration tool to automate the running of the tests with every change to the codebase.
 - Ensure that any failures in the test suite are caught early and can be addressed before they cause issues in production.
