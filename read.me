#78: Ethereal-Spark-patch-3A Implement Spark Streaming for real-time data processing

Overview
 - This pull request aims to implement Spark Streaming for real-time data processing. The following tasks have been identified:

Tasks
1: Understand the requirements and use cases for real-time data processing.
 - Understand the requirements and use cases for real-time data processing: Research and understand the requirements for real-time data processing, including the types of data sources, data formats, data volume, and data latency. Identify the use cases and scenarios where real-time data processing is needed.

2: Familiarize yourself with Spark Streaming's programming model and API.
 - Familiarize yourself with Spark Streaming's programming model and API: Review Spark Streaming's documentation and examples to understand how to create and run Spark Streaming applications. Learn about the basic building blocks of Spark Streaming, such as DStreams, transformations, and output operations.

3: Choose a streaming source, such as Kafka, Flume, or TCP sockets, and set up the necessary configurations.
 - Choose a streaming source and set up the necessary configurations: Choose a streaming source, such as Kafka, Flume, or TCP sockets, and set up the necessary configurations to connect to the source. Test the connection and ensure that data can be received by the Spark Streaming application.

4: Write a basic Spark Streaming application to consume data from the chosen streaming source and process it.
 - Write a basic Spark Streaming application: Write a basic Spark Streaming application to consume data from the chosen streaming source and process it. Start with simple operations, such as filtering, mapping, and aggregating the data. Test the application and ensure that it's working as expected.

5: Add more complexity to the Spark Streaming application, such as filtering, aggregating, and joining data in real-time.
 - Add more complexity to the Spark Streaming application: Add more complexity to the Spark Streaming application, such as joining data streams, calculating windowed aggregates, and applying machine learning models in real-time. Test the application with more complex scenarios and ensure that it's scalable and fault-tolerant.

6: Optimize the Spark Streaming application's performance by tuning the batch interval, parallelism, and serialization settings.
 - Optimize the Spark Streaming application's performance: Optimize the Spark Streaming application's performance by tuning the batch interval, parallelism, and serialization settings. Use Spark's monitoring tools, such as Spark UI and Ganglia, to identify bottlenecks and optimize the application accordingly.

7: Handle failures and retries in the Spark Streaming application, such as network issues, data corruption, and driver crashes.
 - Handle failures and retries in the Spark Streaming application: Handle failures and retries in the Spark Streaming application, such as network issues, data corruption, and driver crashes. Use Spark's fault-tolerance mechanisms, such as checkpointing and stateful transformations, to ensure that the application can recover from failures.

8: Monitor the Spark Streaming application's metrics and logging to ensure it's running smoothly and efficiently.
 - Monitor the Spark Streaming application's metrics and logging: Monitor the Spark Streaming application's metrics and logging to ensure it's running smoothly and efficiently. Use Spark's monitoring tools, such as Spark UI and Ganglia, to monitor the application's resource usage, throughput, and latency. Use logging to debug and troubleshoot issues.

9:Test the Spark Streaming application with realistic data and scenarios to validate its correctness and scalability.
 - Test the Spark Streaming application with realistic data and scenarios: Test the Spark Streaming application with realistic data and scenarios to validate its correctness and scalability. Use performance testing tools, such as JMeter

10: Refactor the Spark Streaming application's code to improve its readability, maintainability, and extensibility.
 - Analyze the existing codebase to identify areas for improvement in terms of readability, maintainability, and extensibility.
 - Break down large, complex functions into smaller, more manageable ones.
 - Remove redundant or unnecessary code.
 - Use meaningful variable and function names to improve code comprehension.
 - Simplify nested conditionals and loops.
 - Reduce code duplication through the use of functions and classes.
 - Ensure consistent coding style and formatting throughout the codebase.
 - Comment code where necessary to clarify intent and functionality.
 - Refactor the code to adhere to SOLID principles and other best practices.
 - Write unit tests for the refactored code to validate its functionality and prevent regressions.
 - Use code analysis tools to identify potential issues and suggest improvements.
 - Document the refactored code and its overall structure and purpose for future reference.
