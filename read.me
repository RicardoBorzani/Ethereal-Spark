#86: Ethereal-Spark-patch-4D Write integration tests for machine learning algorithms

1: Identify the machine learning algorithms implemented in the Spark jobs:
 - Review the code and identify the machine learning algorithms that have been implemented.
 - Create a list of these algorithms for reference.

2: Define the expected input and output data for each algorithm:
 - Determine the expected format and structure of the input data for each algorithm.
 - Define the expected output of each algorithm and its format.

3: Create test data sets that cover a range of possible scenarios and edge cases:
 - Create test data sets that cover different types of scenarios and edge cases to ensure that the algorithms work correctly in all situations.
 - Ensure that the test data sets are representative of real-world data.

4: Implement integration tests that execute the Spark jobs with the test data sets as input:
 - Write integration tests that execute the Spark jobs using the test data sets as input.
 - Ensure that the tests cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.

5: Verify that the output of each algorithm matches the expected results:
 - Verify that the output of each algorithm matches the expected results defined in step 2.
 - Debug and fix any issues that arise during testing.

6: Test the performance and scalability of the algorithms with larger data sets:
 - Test the algorithms' performance and scalability with larger data sets to ensure they can handle the expected workload.

7: Add error handling tests to ensure that the Spark jobs handle exceptions correctly:
 - Write error handling tests to ensure that the Spark jobs handle exceptions and error conditions correctly.

8: Write documentation for the integration tests, including test data sets, expected results, and any specific testing instructions:
 - Write documentation for the integration tests, including information on the test data sets, expected results, and any specific testing instructions.
 - Provide clear and concise instructions on how to run the integration tests.

9: Review and refactor the code as necessary to improve testability and maintainability:
 - Review the code and refactor it as necessary to improve testability and maintainability.
 - Ensure that the code is well-organized and easy to understand.
 - Follow consistent coding standards and formatting guidelines.
