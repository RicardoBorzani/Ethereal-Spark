#87: Ethereal-Spark-patch-4E Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability

1: Identify any duplicated code and extract it into reusable functions or modules.
 - Look for any code that appears more than once in the codebase and extract it into a new function or module that can be reused in multiple places.
 - Update all references to the duplicated code to use the new function or module instead.

2: Simplify complex or nested conditional statements and loops.
 - Look for any complex or nested if/else statements or loops and simplify them by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces of code.
 - Consider using helper functions or refactoring the code to use more modern language features, such as list comprehensions or generator expressions, to simplify the code.

3: Use meaningful and descriptive variable and function names to improve code readability.
 - Make sure that all variables and functions have clear and concise names that accurately reflect their purpose and functionality.
 - Avoid using single-letter variable names or generic names like "data" or "value" that could be confused with other parts of the codebase.

4: Eliminate any unused or unnecessary code or dependencies.
 - Look for any code or dependencies that are no longer used in the codebase and remove them to improve code cleanliness and reduce the risk of conflicts or errors.

5: Refactor any long or complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions.
 - Look for any functions that are excessively long or complex and refactor them into smaller, more focused functions that each handle a specific task.
 - Consider using helper functions or splitting the code into smaller modules to make it easier to manage and maintain.

6: Document code using clear and concise comments to aid future maintenance.
 - Make sure that all code is properly documented with clear and concise comments that explain its purpose, functionality, and any assumptions or requirements.
 - Use comments to explain any complex or non-obvious sections of code, or to provide context for future maintainers.

7: Consider implementing coding style guidelines and best practices to maintain consistency in the codebase.
 - Follow established coding style guidelines and best practices to ensure that the codebase is consistent and easy to read and maintain.
 - Consider using automated code analysis tools or linters to identify and enforce coding standards and catch potential issues early.

8: Consider using code analysis tools to identify potential issues or areas for improvement in the codebase.
 - Use code analysis tools or linters to identify potential issues or areas for improvement in the codebase, such as code smells, anti-patterns, or performance bottlenecks.
 - Address any issues or areas for improvement identified by the tools to improve code quality and maintainability.
