#85: Ethereal-Spark-patch-4C Add support for data visualization and reporting

Overview
 - This pull request adds support for data visualization and reporting in Ethereal Spark. This allows users to analyze and explore data using visualizations and create reports to share insights.

Tasks
1: Research and select a data visualization tool or library that integrates with Spark (e.g., Databricks, Plotly, Apache Zeppelin).
2: Develop a plan for integrating the chosen visualization tool/library with Ethereal Spark.
3: Implement the integration plan by adding the necessary code and configurations.
4: Test the data visualization and reporting features on sample data to ensure accuracy and functionality.
5: Write documentation and provide examples to demonstrate how to use the data visualization and reporting features.

Details
1: Research and select a data visualization tool or library that integrates with Spark (e.g., Databricks, Plotly, Apache Zeppelin).
 - This task involves researching different data visualization tools and libraries that integrate with Spark, such as Databricks, Plotly, or Apache Zeppelin.
 - The chosen tool should have features that align with the data analysis goals of Ethereal Spark and be easily integrated into the existing codebase.
2: Develop a plan for integrating the chosen visualization tool/library with Ethereal Spark.
 - This task involves designing a plan for integrating the chosen tool/library into Ethereal Spark.
 - The plan should identify the necessary code changes, configurations, and dependencies required to integrate the tool/library with Ethereal Spark.
3: Implement the integration plan by adding the necessary code and configurations.
 - This task involves implementing the plan designed in the previous task.
 - The code changes and configurations should be added to the codebase and tested thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
4: Test the data visualization and reporting features on sample data to ensure accuracy and functionality.
 - This task involves testing the data visualization and reporting features using sample data to ensure that they work as expected and provide accurate insights.
5: Write documentation and provide examples to demonstrate how to use the data visualization and reporting features.
 - This task involves creating documentation and examples to help users understand how to use the data visualization and reporting features in Ethereal Spark.
 - The documentation should be clear, concise, and include examples that demonstrate the different features and capabilities of the visualization tool/library.
