# Ethereal-Spark
Data loading component based on Apache Spark. The Ethereal Spark provides a scalable and distributed batch processing engine for your data. It is highly flexible and can be used to perform complex transformations on your data before persisting it to a database.

## Sprint backlog

###  Sprint 16: Data Extraction and Transformation.

#### Description: 
Set up the foundational framework for data extraction and transformation using Apache Spark.
#### Objective: 
In this sprint, we will set up a basic Apache Spark cluster with one worker node and write Spark jobs to extract data from a CSV file, transform data, and aggregate statistics. We will also write unit tests for Spark jobs to ensure that the data transformation process is working correctly.

- Set up a basic Apache Spark cluster with one worker node (3 points)
- Write a Spark job to extract data from a CSV file (5 points)
- Write a Spark job to transform data and aggregate statistics (8 points)
- Write unit tests for Spark jobs (2 points)

###  Sprint 17: Data Optimization and Refactoring.

#### Description: 
Optimize the data caching and partitioning process and refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
#### Objective: 
In this sprint, we will improve Spark job performance by optimizing data caching and partitioning. We will also write Spark jobs to join and merge multiple datasets, implement dynamic schema inference for data extraction, and write integration tests for Spark jobs. Finally, we will refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

- Improve Spark job performance by optimizing data caching and partitioning (8 points)
- Write Spark jobs to join and merge multiple datasets (5 points)
- Implement dynamic schema inference for data extraction (3 points)
- Write integration tests for Spark jobs (3 points)
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability (5 points)

###  Sprint 18: Real-time Data Processing.

#### Description: 
Implement Spark Streaming for real-time data processing and add support for data ingestion from external sources.
#### Objective: 
In this sprint, we will implement Spark Streaming for real-time data processing and write Spark jobs to analyze data trends over time. We will also add support for data ingestion from external sources, such as Kafka or Flume, and write integration tests for Spark Streaming. Finally, we will refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

- Implement Spark Streaming for real-time data processing (8 points)
- Write Spark jobs to analyze data trends over time (5 points)
- Add support for data ingestion from external sources (e.g., Kafka, Flume) (5 points)
- Write integration tests for Spark Streaming (3 points)
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability (5 points)

###  Sprint 19:  Machine Learning and Data Visualization.

#### Description: 
Implement machine learning algorithms for data analysis, perform anomaly detection and predictive modeling, and add support for data visualization and reporting.
#### Objective: 
In this sprint, we will implement machine learning algorithms for data analysis and write Spark jobs to perform anomaly detection and predictive modeling. We will also add support for data visualization and reporting, write integration tests for machine learning algorithms, and refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

- Implement machine learning algorithms for data analysis (8 points)
- Write Spark jobs to perform anomaly detection and predictive modeling (5 points)
- Add support for data visualization and reporting (3 points)
- Write integration tests for machine learning algorithms (3 points)
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability (5 points)
